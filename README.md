ArgoCD Deployment on Kubernetes

This guide will walk you through the best practices for deploying ArgoCD on a Kubernetes cluster.
Prerequisites

Before deploying ArgoCD, you should ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

 A Kubernetes cluster
 kubectl CLI tool installed
 A domain name or IP address to access the ArgoCD UI

Installation

    kubectl apply -f install.yaml


Verify that the ArgoCD server is running:

    kubectl get pods -n argocd

You should see one or more pods with a name starting with argocd-server.

Access the ArgoCD UI:

Open your web browser and navigate to https://{argocd.example.com}. Log in with the default username admin and the password that can be retrieved with:

    kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

Customization

The manifest file includes a number of configurable options that can be used to customize the ArgoCD deployment. Refer to the ArgoCD documentation for a full list of options.
Best Practices

To ensure a secure and reliable deployment of ArgoCD, follow these best practices:

 Use SSL/TLS encryption to secure the ArgoCD UI and API endpoints.
 Use a strong password for the admin user and avoid sharing credentials.
 Enable RBAC to control access to the ArgoCD UI and API endpoints.
 Use a dedicated namespace for ArgoCD to avoid interference with other applications.
 Regularly back up the ArgoCD configuration and backup storage.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation or operation of ArgoCD, refer to the ArgoCD documentation or the ArgoCD documentation for troubleshooting steps.
